# SuperPlato

**SuperPlato** is an attendance automation platform designed for students at Pusan National University (PNU).  
It automates lecture attendance by logging into the PLATO system, locates classrooms across campus buildings, and provides a fully featured REST API consumed by a React frontend.

Originally built as a personal automation tool, SuperPlato now serves as an academic infrastructure prototype and is deployed via Cloudflare Tunnel on a personal Mac mini server.

## 🚀 Installation (Quick Start)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghapert/superplato.git
cd superplato
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup (FastAPI + MySQL)

```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend/ directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Or manually fill the required variables:

```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_HOST/YOUR_DATABASE"
FERNET_KEY=YOUR_FERNET_KEY
SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Optional admin bootstrap
SPECIAL_ADMIN_STUDENT_ID=202512345
SPECIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=superplato
```

**How to generate keys:**

- To generate a Fernet key (for encryption), run:
  ```bash
  python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
  ```
- To generate a random secret key (for FastAPI session/cookie signing), run:
  ```bash
  python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
  ```

Initialize the database and run the server:

```bash
# Run Alembic migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the API server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- Default API URL: http://localhost:8000

---

### 3. Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

- Default Frontend URL: http://localhost:5173

> ⚠️ If you set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your frontend `.env`, make sure it matches the actual backend API URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).  
> This ensures all API requests from the frontend are routed correctly to your backend server.

---

### Frontend Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `frontend/` directory with the following keys:

```env
# API base URL (optional, e.g. http://localhost:8000)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=

# Firebase
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=...

# Kakao Maps
VITE_KAKAO_MAP_API_KEY=...

# Bug report and contact
VITE_BUG_REPORT_EMAIL=...
VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL=...

# Privacy and Terms metadata
VITE_PRIVACY_MANAGER_NAME=...
VITE_PRIVACY_MANAGER_EMAIL=...
VITE_PRIVACY_POLICY_UPDATED_AT=...
VITE_PRIVACY_POLICY_EFFECTIVE_AT=...
VITE_TERMS_UPDATED_AT=...
VITE_TERMS_EFFECTIVE_AT=...
```

You can use `.env.example` as a template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

---

### 4. Firebase Configuration

- Place your Firebase service account key at:  
  `backend/credentials/firebase-service-account.json`
- This file is required for Firebase Authentication and Admin SDK operations.
- Do NOT commit this file to Git. It should be excluded via .gitignore.

---

### 5. Background Runner (Optional, for Pro users)

The background attendance runner (`backend/runners/auto_attendance_runner.py`) is designed to be executed independently.  
To run it, first activate your backend Python virtual environment:

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python runners/auto_attendance_runner.py
```

This script enables true background attendance automation for SuperPlato Pro users.

---

## Features

- Smart Attendance Submission: At the scheduled class time, SuperPlato automatically detects your current lecture and submits the required attendance authentication code for you—no manual selection needed.
- True Background Attendance for Pro Users: If you are a SuperPlato Pro user, you don't even need to enter the attendance code—attendance is fully automated and performed in the background without any manual input.
- Firebase Authentication: Supports secure login, with optional “ProKey” upgrade for privileged users.
- Lecture Locator: Easily find lecture room locations on campus with building codes and map integration.
- Assignment Helper: Upload files or text to OpenAI for grammar and content feedback.
- Attendance Summary & AI Analysis: View a summary of your attendance for each lecture. SuperPlato Pro users receive an additional GPT-powered analysis and feedback on their attendance patterns.
- FastAPI Backend: Modular, scalable architecture using routers, services, and background runners.
- React Frontend (Vite): Built as a Single Page Application with fast reloads and modern tooling.
- Session Management: PLATO login sessions and cookies are stored securely and reused when possible.

## Cautions

- ⚠️ Never commit the following:
  - `.env`
  - `firebase-service-account.json`
  - Any cookie/session storage files
- Temporary runner logs and cookies are excluded via .gitignore
- Future versions will implement encrypted secret storage for greater safety
- **Important:** The "bruteforce" attendance feature (which attempts all possible attendance codes automatically) may be legally or ethically controversial depending on your institution's policy. **Use of this feature is discouraged and at your own risk.**
